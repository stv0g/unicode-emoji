# Unicode Emonjis for Pidgin

This repository contains three sets of emojis:

*  original Apple Color Emojis
   as used in iOS
*  original Android Emojis
   extracted from Android OS
*  Symbola Emojis
   mostly the original Unicode.org draft pictograms

These Smilies can easily be used in Pidgin by copying the folders to ~/.purple/smileys

Please note that every smiley maps to his dedicated unicode character as specified by Unicode 6.0.
This enables interoperability withs Android & iOS chats clients.
Other chat partners might want to install either the Symbola or Android TrueType font the see the Emojis
